For my Software Engineering I class, my portfolio project was a news website where one could enter topics they were interested in. The website would scrape news.google.com for more info on those topics, then present those related articles to the user on their homepage. <br>

I was running into some bugs while webscraping, so I created this smaller program to more easily isolate/test problems as they came up.
